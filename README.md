# Incremental Learning

*Also called lifelong learning, or continual learning.*

This repository will store all my implementations of Incremental Learning's papers.

## Structures

Every model must inherit `inclearn.models.base.IncrementalLearner`.

## Papers implemented:

:white_check_mark: --> Paper implemented & reached expected (or more) results.\
:construction: --> Runnable but not yet reached expected results.\
:x: --> Not yet implemented or barely working.

:white_check_mark: iCaRL\
:construction: Learning without Forgetting (LwF)\
:white_check_mark: End-to-End Incremental Learning (E2E)\
:x: Overcoming catastrophic forgetting (EWC)



## TODO

- [ ] Add subparser per paper
